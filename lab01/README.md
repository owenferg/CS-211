# lab01-intervals

An introductory lab exercise for CIS 211, related to the Agenda main 
project.  This exercise introduces 
- classes, which is how we add new types of objects to Python, 
- objects, which are the values of the new types we create, 
- methods, which are like functions specialized to classes, and 
- "magic" methods (aka "special" methods), which are automatically 
  invoked through some built-in functions like `str`, or through 
  operations like `+`

This exercise is designed to be led by a graduate teaching assistant
in a scheduled lab. 

Look in doc/HOWTO.md for detailed directions.
