# lab02-fractions

Fraction Class
In this lab session, you'll code a new Python class to represent Fraction objects.

The main topics you'll practice during this lab are:

Defining magic and non-magic methods.
Creating methods that generate new objects.
Creating methods that modify the caller object (a.k.a mutators).
Read the instructions carefully and ask for clarification from your TA/LA if necessary.

IMPORTANT: Remember to use type hinting in your method headers specifying the argument types and the return type.

Look in doc/HOWTO.md for detailed directions.
